All international travelers to India must have a valid passport and an Indian visa unless exempt under specific bilateral agreements. Persons of Indian origin must possess an OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) card.

Visas can be obtained through two methods: e-Visa and regular visa. The e-Visa process is more straightforward and quicker, typically taking 3-4 business days.

Nationals from 166 countries can avail themselves of the e-Visa, and the full list is available on the e-Visa portal. Those who do not qualify for an [e-Visa](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/) must apply for a standard visa at the nearest Indian Mission or Embassy in their home country.

Those travelling to India are also advised to go through instructions available on the [official website of Bureau of Immigration](https://www.india.gov.in/official-website-bureau-immigration).

# Conference visa

We suggest you apply for the e-Conference visa [instead of the tourist visa](https://www.mha.gov.in/PDF_Other/ForeigD-FAQ-TVisa280710.pdf) for your visit to India for UbuCon Asia'24. Those applying for an e-Conference visa can also do some tourism before and after the event.

 
The e-Conference visa is only valid for 30 days from the date of arrival into India. In case you are planning to stay longer than that, we advice you to look for other types of visa on [official website](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/).


To apply for either e-Conference visa or regular conference visa, you will require invitation from the organizer and Political clearance from Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Government of India. Please contact contact@ubucon.asia 

We can provide you a visa invitation letter once your registration is confirmed. We will have to mention who will pay for your expenses in the invitation letter, so if you are applying for a travel grant we will have to wait for travel grant approval before we can send you the visa invitation. If your expenses are covered by someone else, like your employer, then mention that in your email, so we can include that information in your invite letter.

For us to send visa invitation letters, please email us your:

1. Full name, as it appears on your passport
2. Passport number
3. Date of birth
4. Place (country) of birth
5. Nationality
6. Home Address
7. Photos of page(s) of your passport with personal information, personal photograph and passport number.

The invitation letter will be provided by JECRC Incubation Centre Foundation. The information above, including the passport scans, will be shared with them.

The visa invitation letter process will take us at least three weeks, please remember to request as early as possible. We have to submit the list of participants who need visa to Ministry of External Affairs and get Political clearance from Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Government of India (this can take up to two weeks). Getting signature from JECRC in the invitation letter also takes time (this is processed in multiple batches).

Note: We will be able to provide you invitation letter only if you send passport details by 10th May.
